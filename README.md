# nemo
Private project help computer to understand and learn trending cultures

# Name and idea
The name of this project come from **"Neta"/梗** (Janpanese) and  **"Memo"/表情包**. 
Nowdays, internet culture is growing fast. Somewhat, even young people couldn't "get" the meaning of some trending words or memos. 
I was strongly influenced by Chinese *internet culture, Japanese Bangumi and American memos*. I spent a lot time online to consume and create those memos. Suddenly I realize this is a good direction for me to practice and sharpen my skills.  

# Schedual  
- words: To analyse words in internet, to understand the real meaning of those words;
- static pictures: First steps is to identify static photos. I think this could include following techs ( OCR, NLP, machine learning, scrapy...);
- dynamic pictures: recognize .gif format memos; 
- real-time "danmuku" (Janpanese): select danmuku from thousands of meaningless danmuku which suit the backgroud video most;
- real-time "memo fighting/斗图" suggestion system: In China, when we chat with our friends, we just use memos instead of typing, it would very helpful if there is a system could help us find and recommend memo for me.
